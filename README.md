## About Me

I am currently a student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology (CBIT). My technical journey spans:

- **Databases**: Design and management for scalable applications.
- **Generative AI**: Building intelligent systems that create, learn, and adapt.
- **Langchain & RAG Agents**: Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for dynamic knowledge workflows.
- **Website Generation**: Automation and customization, including transforming user inputs into structured data for bespoke website builders.
- **IoT & Sensors**: Projects involving temperature sensors and high-temperature detection.

## Featured Project

**Automated Website Builder with Structured JSON via Langchain**

- Developed a system that takes user input and leverages Langchain to generate structured JSON files.
- These JSON files drive a company’s custom website building software—streamlining the transition from user intent to ready-to-deploy web assets.
- Emphasized clarity and data integrity in the conversion process.

## Other Technical Interests

- Sensor integration in web apps (e.g., real-time temperature monitoring and alerts).
- Exploring the intersection of AI reasoning and web automation.
